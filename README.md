## Smart Tacos Android App

### Developpement guidelines :

1. Fork the project into your github Account, to do this, click **Fork** in the top-right corner of the page.
2. ``` Git Clone < Repo Forked in your github Account > ```
3. ``` Git push ``` your work in progress
4. When you finish a task create a **pull request** to the **develop** branch and **not** to the **master** branch.
5. Your changes will be treated by the git integrator and merged when needed. Also, you can receive some feedbacks on your code.
6. Check regulary ``` git status ``` and ``` git rebase ``` when your branch is behind the **develop** branch.

The reason for this is that your changes will not be automaticly added to the project unless we all agreed about them.

If you noticed any bug please report it by creating an **issue** in **smartTacosApp** repos. 

**ps :** when you fork this repos, it will be synchronized by your repos. 

#### Happy Hacking ;)
